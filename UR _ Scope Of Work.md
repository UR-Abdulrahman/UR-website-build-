# **Independent Studio Service Model \- "Membership Access Pricing"**

## **Overview**

Our new service model for independent fitness studios operates on a membership-based access system. To receive discounted service rates, studios must have their website built within our GoHighLevel system. This acts as your "membership" that unlocks access to our full suite of services at significantly reduced rates compared to custom builds.

**Think of it like Costco:** You pay for the membership, then access wholesale pricing on services.

## **Required Entry Point: Website Build**

**What's Included:**

* On-page SEO optimization  
* Full GoHighLevel account setup & configuration

* Mobile-responsive design  
* Integration-ready for all Untapped Revenue systems

**Why This Is Required:** This website build creates your foundation in our system and unlocks access to our discounted service pricing.

## **Why This Model Works**

**Risk Reversal:** Start with just website \+ CRM for $197/month. Add services as you grow.

**No Long-Term Commitment:** Month-to-month pricing on all services. Cancel anytime (though why would you when it's generating 15+ new members monthly?).

**Ultimate Flexibility:** Add or remove services month-to-month based on your studio's needs. Seasonal? Add ads in January, drop to base service in summer.

**Proven Systems:** You're getting the exact same systems that generated $46.3M for 100+ studios \- just packaged for maximum flexibility.

**Future-Proof:** As we develop new services (reactivation campaigns, review generation, etc.), you'll have first access to add them to your account.
