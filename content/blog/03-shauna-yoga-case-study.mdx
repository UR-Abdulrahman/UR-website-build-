Shauna runs a premium yoga studio. Her classes are full. Her retention is good. Her members love her.

But for two years, she couldn't break 150 members. She'd tried running her own Facebook ads — generic weight loss messaging, broad targeting, $1,000/month in spend — and got a stream of leads who never showed up.

Four months after working with us, she had 275 members. 537 first visits. $5.65 average cost per lead. And her Google review count went from 55 to 180 — generating compounding organic traffic that still drives leads today.

Here's exactly what we did and why it worked.

## The Problem: Talking to Everyone, Reaching No One

Shauna's previous ads looked like most yoga studio ads: "Lose weight, reduce stress, try yoga free for a week!" Broad targeting. Broad messaging. Broad results.

The issue wasn't the offer — yoga genuinely helps people lose weight and reduce stress. The issue was that "people who might want to lose weight and try yoga" is essentially the entire internet.

When you speak to everyone, you speak to no one.

The leads she was getting were low-intent curiosity clicks — people who thought "oh, maybe" when they saw the ad, entered their email, and then forgot about it entirely. Her follow-up rate was under 20%. Her show-up rate on the rare bookings was around 40%.

The algorithm had been trained for months to find more of these low-intent clickers. The well was poisoned.

## What We Changed

**1. Avatar-Specific Campaigns**

Instead of one campaign for "people who want yoga," we built separate campaigns for distinct audience segments:

- **Postpartum moms** — messaging around rebuilding strength and confidence after kids, in a supportive non-intimidating environment
- **Women 35–55** — focused on community, flexibility, stress relief, and a consistent movement practice
- **Beginners** — explicitly welcoming people who've always wanted to try yoga but felt intimidated

Each avatar got completely different creative, different copy, and different offer framing. The messaging was specific enough that anyone outside that avatar would scroll past — which is exactly what we wanted.

**2. Conversion API Setup**

We rebuilt her pixel tracking from scratch using Facebook's Conversion API. Instead of optimizing for clicks, we optimized for bookings and show-ups. Every optimization signal from that point forward trained the algorithm toward people who actually showed up.

**3. AI-Powered Follow-Up**

The moment a lead opted in, our AI system responded within 60 seconds. It asked qualifying questions, learned about the lead's goals, and worked to book them into a class — conversationally, without pressure.

The difference was immediate. Response rate went from under 20% to 82%. Booking rate from 25% to 68%.

## The Results Over 4 Months

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| First visits (show-ups) | 537 |
| New paying members added | +129 |
| Member count | 146 → 275 |
| Average cost per lead | $5.65 |
| Google reviews | 55 → 180 |

The Google review growth deserves a special note. As part of our CRM workflow, we run automated review campaigns to members at key milestones. Growing from 55 to 180 reviews didn't just improve her local SEO ranking — it created social proof that converted organic searchers at a dramatically higher rate than cold ad traffic.

## What's Driving Results Today

Shauna continues to run with us. The algorithm has now been trained for months toward her ideal member — and cost per lead continues to improve, not decline.

The Google review engine keeps compounding. Organic search traffic now supplements paid traffic significantly, and organic leads convert at 15–25% better rates because they arrive with intent.

This is the compounding effect of doing it right from the start.
