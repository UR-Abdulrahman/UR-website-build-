## Posting Workflow

1. Copy `_TEMPLATE.mdx` → new file: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx` or `07-slug.mdx`
2. Fill in frontmatter (title, slug, date, description, tags, author)
3. Write post in UR voice: direct, specific numbers, no fluff
4. `git add content/blog/[new-file].mdx`
5. `git commit -m "blog: add post - [title]"`
6. `git push` → Vercel auto-deploys

**Pro tip:** Write 2–3 posts at once during a content session. Schedule them by setting the `date` field to future dates (the blog sorts by date).
