**UNTAPPED REVENUE**

Website Copywriting & Design Brief

*A Complete Reference for AI-Assisted Website Development*

# **SECTION 1: COMPANY OVERVIEW**

Use this section to establish the brand voice, mission, and core identity for the homepage hero, About section, and meta descriptions.

## **1.1 Who We Are**

Untapped Revenue is a done-for-you marketing agency exclusively serving class-based fitness studios — yoga, Pilates, CrossFit, HIIT, MMA, and more. We are not a generalist agency. We do not work with restaurants, e-commerce brands, or real estate. Every single system, ad template, follow-up workflow, and reporting framework we have built is engineered specifically for gym and studio owners.

In the last 17 months alone, we have helped 100+ fitness studios generate $46.3 million in combined revenue. That is not a projection. That is a documented result pulled directly from client MindBody accounts, CRM pipelines, and ad dashboards.

## **1.2 Headline Statistics (Use Throughout the Site)**

These are verified proof points to use in hero sections, social proof banners, and CTAs:

* $46.3 million in revenue generated for clients in 17 months

* 100+ gyms and fitness studios served

* Hundreds of documented case studies and testimonials

* $3–$6 average cost per lead (fitness industry average is $15–$30)

* 80%+ response rates on follow-up campaigns

* 30–40% trial-to-membership conversion rates (industry average is 20–25%)

* Starting at just $197/month — a fraction of what traditional agencies charge

## **1.3 Mission Statement**

Our mission is to help 200 gym and fitness studio owners double their memberships while giving them back their time — so they can stop wearing every hat in their business and start running it like a real company.

# **SECTION 2: CORE DIFFERENTIATORS**

This is the most important section for homepage copy, ads, and any comparison-style content. Every differentiator should be backed by a specific proof point — no fluff.

## **2.1 Hyper-Specific Audience Targeting (Not Generic "Weight Loss" Ads)**

Most marketing agencies serving gyms run the same recycled playbook: broad ads targeting "women in \[city\] who want to lose weight." The result? Cheap leads who never show up, never convert, and actively train the Facebook algorithm to deliver more of the same garbage.

Untapped Revenue operates on a completely different philosophy: when you speak to everyone, you speak to no one.

We build separate campaigns targeting specific, distinct audience segments with messaging that speaks directly to their unique pain points, motivations, and desires. Examples of the audience avatars we build for:

* Postpartum moms rebuilding their strength and confidence after having kids

* Men 35–55 looking to build functional strength, lose stubborn belly fat, and feel like themselves again

* Athletes seeking sport-specific conditioning (MMA, jiu-jitsu, CrossFit competitors)

* "Silver Sneakers" — adults 55+ focused on longevity, joint health, and staying active

* Busy professionals who want an efficient, structured workout with community accountability

* New movers to an area looking to find their fitness home

This level of specificity does two critical things: it attracts higher-intent leads who are far more likely to convert, and it feeds the Facebook algorithm with better data — resulting in improving lead quality over time, not declining quality.

## **2.2 The Algorithmic Bias Problem (And Our Solution)**

Facebook secretly sabotages gym ad accounts — and most agencies have no idea it's happening. Here is how it works:

Every time a low-quality lead clicks your ad, Facebook's algorithm registers that as a signal: "this is the type of person this gym wants." It then goes and finds more people just like them. Within weeks, your ad account is optimized to deliver broke, unmotivated, no-show leads — and you have trained it to do exactly that.

We call this algorithmic bias, and we have spent years reverse-engineering how to fix it. Our three-part solution:

* Conversion API pixel setup to optimize for bookings and show-ups — not just clicks

* Hyper-specific offer messaging to attract only qualified prospects from the first impression

* Lead form filtration questions to pre-screen leads before they trigger an optimization event

The result: our clients' lead quality improves every single month. Other agencies watch their results collapse after 4–6 weeks. Ours get stronger.

## **2.3 Sprint Testing System — 15–20 Offers Tested for \~$30 Total**

The typical agency approach to ad testing: pick one offer, run it for 7–10 days, spend $200–$400, and hope it works. If it doesn't, start over.

Our sprint testing system tests 15–20 completely different offers, hooks, and headlines simultaneously — for approximately $30 total. Here is how:

* We create color block images in Canva (high-contrast, scroll-stopping designs) — one per offer variation

* We run all 20 as a traffic campaign in a single Facebook ad set with a $20–$30 daily budget

* Automated rules shut off each ad at 400 impressions or if cost-per-click exceeds $1.50

* The winner — identified by highest click-through rate — gets rolled out as a full lead generation campaign

This approach generates 10–15x more testing data per dollar spent than any other method we have seen. It is why our clients stop guessing what works and start knowing.

## **2.4 Dual-Channel Lead Generation: Paid Ads \+ Organic SEO**

Most agencies either run ads or do SEO. We do both — and we engineer them to compound on each other.

Paid ads generate immediate leads and simultaneously drive more branded searches, profile visits, and direct website traffic. That organic traffic — people who found you through Google or word of mouth — converts at 15–25% better rates than cold ad traffic because they arrived with intent.

We build every client a website within GoHighLevel that is fully SEO-optimized from day one: on-page structure, schema markup, Google Analytics, Search Console setup, and monthly reporting via Search Atlas. You are not just running ads into a leaky bucket — you are building a long-term organic lead engine at the same time.

## **2.5 100% Hands-Off System — We Handle Everything**

Most studio owners who hire an agency still end up doing half the work themselves: responding to leads manually, chasing no-shows, trying to figure out why their booking rate dropped. That is not what we do.

From the moment a lead opts into your system, our team and our AI-powered automations handle everything required to get them walking through your door:

* Immediate follow-up within 1–10 minutes via AI-powered text and email (industry studies show response speed is the \#1 driver of lead conversion)

* Conversation management — we ask questions, handle objections, and guide leads toward booking

* Appointment booking directly into your calendar or class schedule

* Pre-visit reminders to maximize show-up rates

* Reactivation campaigns to cold leads who went quiet

* Weekly automated performance reports tracking response rate, booking rate, show-up rate, and trial-to-membership conversion

* Monthly strategy calls with Loom video updates

The only thing we need from you: show up and close the trial into a membership. Everything else is handled.

## **2.6 Fitness-Exclusive Expertise**

We do not work with anyone outside the fitness industry. This is intentional. Our entire team, systems, scripts, automations, offer frameworks, and reporting structures are built around one industry. We know your seasonality, your common objections, your membership pricing models, your trial conversion benchmarks, and your MindBody or Zenplanner integrations.

Generalist agencies that serve 12 different industries will never have this depth. When you work with Untapped Revenue, you are working with the most specialized team in the fitness marketing space.

## **2.7 Pricing That Makes Sense**

Most full-service marketing agencies charge $3,000–$7,000 per month and deliver a generic strategy with a junior account manager. Our complete, hands-off member acquisition system — including ad management, CRM, AI follow-up, and reporting — starts at $600/month USD for independent studios.

For studios that just want the foundation, our website and CRM management package starts at $197/month. There is no other agency in this space delivering this level of service at this price point.

# **SECTION 3: SERVICE OFFERINGS**

Use this section to build the Pricing or Services page. Present the tiers clearly with the Costco-model framing.

## **3.1 Framing: The "Costco Model" for Independent Studios**

Think of our service structure like a Costco membership. You pay a one-time entry fee (your website build at $997–$1,500 USD) to unlock access to our entire suite of services at wholesale pricing. Once you are in the system, you pay only for what you need — and you can add or remove services month to month with no long-term contract.

## **3.2 Required Entry Point: Website Build**

One-time investment: $997–$1,500 USD

Includes: Full website built in GoHighLevel, on-page SEO, mobile-responsive design, form setup, automation configuration, A2P 10DLC phone registration, Google Analytics and Search Console setup, and full integration with all Untapped Revenue systems.

This is not optional — it is the foundation that makes everything else work and unlocks discounted monthly pricing.

## **3.3 Monthly Service Tiers**

| Tier | Price (USD/mo) | What's Included |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Base Service** | **$197/mo** | Website & CRM management, unlimited site changes, monthly reports, technical GHL support |
| **\+ AI Follow-Up** | **$297/mo** | Everything in Base \+ AI-powered lead response (1-min response time), appointment booking automations, 24/7 lead coverage |
| **FB/IG Ads ⭐ Most Popular** | **$600/mo** | Everything above \+ complete Facebook & Instagram ad management, daily optimization, creative development, weekly reporting, monthly strategy calls. All-inclusive — replaces base fee. |
| **\+ Google Ads** | **$900/mo** | Everything in FB/IG Ads tier \+ Google search and display campaign management, keyword targeting, daily optimization |

Note: Franchise partners (Oxygen Yoga & Fitness and similar multi-location brands) are on a separate white-glove model at $997 USD / $1,300 CAD per month, which includes MindBody integration management and dedicated account management from day one.

## **3.4 What We Don't Do (Transparency Builds Trust)**

Include this on the services or FAQ page to set expectations and build credibility:

* We do not run multiple offers simultaneously — one powerful, tested offer runs at a time

* We do not manage your social media content or post on your behalf

* We do not write email sequences

* We do not communicate with your active members or trialers — that relationship is yours

* We do not build custom landing page funnels (available as a $300 one-time add-on if requested)

# **SECTION 5: HOW IT WORKS (PROCESS PAGE)**

Use this section to build a step-by-step "How It Works" page or section. Keep it simple, visual-friendly, and outcome-focused.

## **Step 1 — Book a Free Strategy Call**

We learn about your studio, your current member count, your goals, and what has or hasn't worked in the past. If we're a fit, we'll map out exactly which service tier makes sense for your situation.

## **Step 2 — Website Build & System Setup (Days 1–14)**

We build your GoHighLevel website from scratch — fully branded, SEO-optimized, and integrated with your CRM and follow-up automations. You review, approve, and we go live. Your digital infrastructure is now built to convert visitors into leads and leads into members.

## **Step 3 — Offer Testing & Ad Launch**

We run our sprint testing system: 15–20 color block offer variations tested simultaneously for approximately $30 total. Within 48–72 hours we know exactly which offer your local market responds to. That winner becomes the foundation of your lead generation campaign.

## **Step 4 — AI Follow-Up Handles the Conversations**

The moment a lead opts in, our AI-powered system responds within 60 seconds. It asks qualifying questions, handles objections, offers class times, and books the appointment directly into your calendar — all without you lifting a finger.

## **Step 5 — You Get Weekly Reports, We Handle the Rest**

Every week you receive an automated performance report tracking every stage of your funnel: how many leads came in, how many responded, how many booked, how many showed up, and how many converted to paid memberships. Monthly strategy calls keep you in the loop on what's working and what we're optimizing.

## **Step 6 — Scale What's Working**

Once your campaign is consistently hitting 25+ bookings per month, we methodically scale ad spend by 20–30% every 3 days to grow volume without disrupting the algorithm. Most clients hit their revenue targets within 60–90 days.

# **SECTION 6: IDEAL CLIENT PROFILE**

Use this section to build the "Is This Right For You?" or "Who We Work With" page. Be specific — specificity increases qualified lead quality on your own site.

## **Who We Work With**

* Class-based fitness studios: yoga, Pilates, CrossFit, HIIT, MMA, kickboxing, dance fitness, barre, and similar formats

* Studios charging $100+ per month for membership (premium positioning)

* Studios generating $10,000+ in monthly revenue

* 50+ active members (established, not brand new start-ups)

* Studio owners who want to grow but are too busy running their business to run their marketing

* Owners who have tried ads before and been burned by generic agencies with no fitness expertise

## **Who We Do Not Work With**

* Brand-new studios with fewer than 50 members or under $10K monthly revenue

* Big-box gyms and franchises with in-house marketing teams (unless through a franchise partnership agreement)

* Personal trainers or solo operators without a physical studio location

* Any fitness business outside the class-based studio model

# **SECTION 7: BRAND VOICE & COPY DIRECTION**

* Results-obsessed — every claim is backed by a specific number or documented result

* Bold but not arrogant — we are proud of our results and we speak plainly about them

* Empathetic to the studio owner's reality — they are overworked, they've been burned before, and they need to trust us quickly

* Conversational — write like a smart, confident person speaking, not like a press release

## **7.2 Copy Principles**

* "Screams not whispers" — bold claims, big numbers, specific proof points up front

* Specificity over vagueness — "$46.3 million" not "millions of dollars," "17 months" not "over a year"

* Show don't tell — lead with results, then explain how

* Eliminate hedge words — remove "we think," "we hope," "we believe" wherever possible

* Make the reader feel the gap between their current situation and what's possible

## **7.3 Key Phrases to Use**

* "Done-for-you" — emphasize the hands-off nature consistently

* "The Self-Sustaining AI Member Accelerator" — our flagship system name

* "Algorithmic bias" — use this term, it's distinctive and educational

* "Sprint testing" — our proprietary offer testing methodology

* "When you speak to everyone, you speak to no one" — use in context of targeting

* "$46.3 million in 17 months" — always lead with this proof point

## **7.4 What to Avoid**

* Generic marketing language: "innovative solutions," "full-service agency," "results-driven"

* Vague promises without numbers: "grow your gym," "get more leads"

* Comparisons to specific named competitors

* Any mention of social media management, email sequences, or landing page funnels (we don't offer these)

# **SECTION 9: MASTER AI PROMPT TEMPLATE**

Copy and paste this prompt into any AI website builder, copywriting tool, or design platform. Fill in the bracketed sections as needed.

**START OF AI PROMPT**

You are building a high-converting marketing website for Untapped Revenue, a done-for-you fitness studio marketing agency. Here is everything you need to know:

**COMPANY: Untapped Revenue**

NICHE: Exclusively serves class-based fitness studios (yoga, Pilates, CrossFit, HIIT, MMA, barre). Does not work outside this niche.

CORE PROOF POINT: Generated $46.3 million in revenue for 100+ fitness studios in 17 months.

PRICE POINT: Starts at $197/month — complete done-for-you system at $600/month. Fraction of typical agency pricing.

**KEY DIFFERENTIATORS (build the site around these):**

1\. HYPER-SPECIFIC TARGETING: We target distinct audience avatars (postpartum moms, men building strength, silver sneakers, athletes) with messaging tailored to each group's specific pain points — not generic weight loss ads. "When you speak to everyone, you speak to no one."

2\. ALGORITHMIC BIAS SOLUTION: We have reverse-engineered Facebook's algorithm to prevent lead quality decay. Most gyms' ads work for 1–2 weeks then collapse — ours improve over time.

3\. SPRINT TESTING: Proprietary method to test 15–20 offer variations simultaneously for \~$30 total — vs. $30 per test the traditional way. Data-driven, not guesswork.

4\. TRULY HANDS-OFF: We handle lead follow-up (1–10 min response time), appointment booking, reactivation campaigns, weekly reporting, and monthly strategy calls. Studio owner only needs to show up and close trials.

5\. DUAL CHANNEL: Paid ads \+ organic SEO working together. Organic leads convert 15–25% better than cold ad traffic.

6\. PROVEN RESULTS: Shauna (yoga, \+129 members in 4 months, $5.65/lead), Dan (yoga, \+227 members in 11 months, $6/lead, 1,800+ show-ups), Haley (+100 members in 3 months).

TONE: Direct, confident, bold, results-obsessed. Use specific numbers always. No hedging. Think Alex Hormozi copywriting style — confident without being arrogant. "Screams not whispers" — bold claims with proof.

WHAT WE DON'T DO (mention for transparency): No social media posting, no email sequences, no landing page funnels (unless $300 add-on requested), no multi-offer simultaneous campaigns, no member/trialer communication.

PAGES NEEDED: Homepage, Results/Case Studies, Services/Pricing, How It Works, About, Book a Call.

PRIMARY CTA EVERYWHERE: "Book Your Free Strategy Call" — 30-minute call to map out a custom growth plan.

DESIGN DIRECTION: Professional but bold. Dark navy blue (\#1E3A5F) primary, red-orange accent (\#E8371B) for CTAs and proof points. Clean, modern, mobile-first. Lots of white space. Hero section should immediately hit with the $46.3M proof point and a clear CTA. Results should be front and center — not buried.
